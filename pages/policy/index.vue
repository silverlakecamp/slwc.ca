          <h2 id="head-lice">Head Lice</h2>

          <br>

          <p>At Silver Lake Wesleyan Camp we strive to maintain a consistently healthy environment for our campers. As a community living in close quarters, head lice can spread quickly and be hard to eliminate. In an effort to prevent lice, we ask parents to check their child’s head before they come to camp. In order to assist parents and maintain a healthy camp we abide by the following policy:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Upon check-in on the first day of camp each camper will be checked for head lice.</li>
            <li>If any lice or nits are found at that time or at any time during the camping session, the camper will be asked to return home.</li>
            <li>
              Once the camper is lice and nit free, they will have the following options:
              <ul>
                <li>Choose another week – Parents can bring their child back for another week of equal value during the current summer, if space is available.</li>
                <li>In the event another week is not available you may choose a refund (two-thirds of the fee)</li>
                <li>Apply 2/3 of the current year fee towards your child’s camp the following season.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          <h2 id="dogs">Dogs</h2>

          <br>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Dogs are welcome on the grounds... so long as they are on a leash and under the control of an adult who cleans up after them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Due to allergies and sanitation issues, we do not permit dogs in accommodations or other public buildings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dogs are not permitted on the beach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dogs must have current rabies vaccinations (please have proof available upon request) as per the Department of Health regulation which states: Every operator shall ensure that no animal that is susceptible to rabies is brought into a camp unless the animal has been immunized against rabies at least thirty days and not more than fifteen months prior to the bringing of the animal into the camp. R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 568, s. 7 (3)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br>

          <p>Here at SLWC we understand that life happens, plans change and circumstances beyond your control may necessitate the cancellation of your camp registration. We also realize that budgets are built, staff hired and supplies purchased based on registrations, all of which are impacted by cancellations. So that there are no surprises or misunderstandings here is what happens in the case of cancellation.</p>
