      <h1>1000 CAMPERS CELEBRATION</h1>
      <v-layout row wrap>
        <p>
          Here is some info about a very exciting promotion we're undertaking at Silver Lake Wesleyan Camp. We're
          calling
          it our <b>1000 CAMPERS CELEBRATION</b> and it's exactly what the title says.
        </p>

        <p>
          But first, a little back story. Back in as late as 2007 the camp was struggling to keep itself afloat.
          Registrations were down, leaseholder engagement was down and rentals were practically non existent. With right
          around 200 campers for the entire season that year (222 to be exact) the discussion was starting to be had as
          to
          whether camp ministry (as a whole, or simply at SLWC) had run it's course and needed to “put out to pasture”
          as
          they say. There was some serious discussion about the the future of Silver Lake Wesleyan Camp and it's
          position,
          and value, in the Central Canada District.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, since then, God has been up to some things. Since 2007 we have experienced steady growth in all the
          areas
          of the camp and over the last 5 years, this growth has become exponential. For today, we'll focus just on our
          camper registrations. In 2017, 10 year's after we were at 222 campers we found ourselves with just over 400
          campers (409). Then in 2018 we grew to over 500 campers. In 2019 we had over 600 campers (you can see where
          this
          is going). 2020 hit and COVID-19 had a drastic effect on us all. But we changed things up and started day
          camps
          with over 300 attending, many with their families, that summer. In 2021 the growth did not stop and we were
          excited to welcome over 800 campers for the first time at SLWC. In fact we had 254 registered for our Collide
          Weekend alone (moved to September, due to COVID cancellations in June), which is more campers than we had the
          entire summer of 2007.

          So… have we set the picture up for you enough? Have we gotten you excited about what God is up to at SLWC.
          Well
          we hope so, cause here it is. In honour of our <b>1000 CAMPERS CELEBRATION</b> we are going to give away <b>
            FREE CAMP FOR
            LIFE!!!!
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          One lucky winner is going to get <b>CAMP FOR LIFE</b>, but that's not all, a whole bunch of other 2nd, 3rd and
          even
          4th
          prize winner will get smaller (still pretty awesome) prizes. And here is how it's going to work. All you have
          to
          do to enter into our <b>GRAND PRIZE DRAW</b> is to register for camp. Then, when we hit 1000 campers we are
          going to
          draw from that list of 1000 campers for one person to win <b>FREE CAMP FOR LIFE</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>CAMP FOR LIFE</b> will include one registration each season for the camp of the winners choice up to and
          including
          Youth Camp. This prize will not include Geezer Camp, Family Camp nor our Spring or Fall Retreats (though
          registrations for those do include you to win, and they also include you to win any of our 2nd, 3rd (and did
          we
          mention) 4th place prizes. Since the <b>FREE CAMP FOR LIFE</b> will be limited to our kids and youth camps we
          wanted to
          make sure the winner gets to enjoy this prize for a while. So we are limiting the entries for the GRAND PRIZE
          DRAW to campers born in 2018 or after (aka turning 14 years old this year). Don't worry, everyone else will be
          eligible for our 2nd place prize which is a <b>FREE CAMP</b> for 2023 and that DOES included everyone and can
          be used
          for any of our camps or retreats for those winners.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it doesn't stop there. While there will be only <b>ONE GRAND PRIZE WINNER</b> of our <b>1000 CAMPERS
            CELEBRATION</b> there
          are going to be <b>NINE</b> (that's 9!) <b>2nd prize winners</b> of a <b>FREE CAMP</b> in 2023, there will be
          <b>FIVE 3rd
            Prize winners</b>
          for a <b>FREE SLWC HOODIE</b>, and there will be <b>EIGHT 4th Prize winners of FREE SLWC SWAG PACKS</b>. See
          what we
          did there
          1, 9, 5, 8? SLWC was established back in 1958.

          automatically
          enter you in to our <b>1000 CAMPERS CELEBRATION DRAW</b>. We don't know when we'll draw but it will be if and
          when we
          get our 1000th camper registration for this season. And hey, if we don't hit 1000 campers this summer, we'll
          try
          again next year. But we REALLY want to do it this summer!
        </p>

          So pay attention to our social channels as we'll announce when we hit milestones for camps this year. We have
          already hit 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and we just passed 600 campers, by the way. Of some note: we have passed
          all
          current year over year tracking to this point and are actually ahead of our highest registrations by July 1st,
          and it's still May! If you haven't already, you can register any time at <nuxt-link to="/give">slwc.ca/camps
          </nuxt-link> and get your name in our
          <b>1000 CAMPERS CELEBRATION</b> DRAW.

          <b>1000 CAMPERS CELEBRATION </b> and our give away of <b>FREE CAMP FOR LIFE</b>.
          We can't wait to see who wins and we can't wait to share the love of Jesus with all the campers
          that join us this summer at SLWC.
