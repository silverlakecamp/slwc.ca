          <h2>History</h2>

          <br>

          <p>Established in 1958 by the Wesleyan Methodist Church as a place to gather for annual retreat, conference and children's camps. Supporters built cottages along the lakefront and throughout the 50 acres of property in support of the ministry, giving time as volunteers at camp and utilizing their cottages for vacations and family gathering spots. A 12-unit motel (Bethany Lodge) was constructed in 1975.</p>

          <p>The camp saw steady growth until the mid to late 1980's including the construction of dorms, a "tabernacle", gymnasium, and dining facility. During the 1990's until 2007, a spiralling decline caused serious concern as to the future of the camp. In 2008, the camp experienced a major make-over with steady stream of demolition of deteriorating structures, construction of new facilities, removal of accumulated debris, upgrading of buildings and ministry renewal has resulted in growth in several areas.</p>

          <p>Since 2008, a season of growth and renewal fills stakeholders with hope and a sense that things once thought impossible are now considered doable. Camp and retreat registrations have grown. Donation income is up and the operations budget is improving. A positive atmosphere abounds!</p>

          <h2>SLWC Today</h2>

          <br>

          <p>We fulfill our mission through a growing slate of camps and retreats. The summer is full of camps for children, teens, adults and families including age appropriate activities, games, Bible teaching, worship, nature exploration, crafts and lots of opportunity to build relationships with God and others.</p>

          <p>The property is often rented to groups who wish to retreat for prayer, renewal, teaching and team building. We also have a few housekeeping cottages available for families to rent for a weekend or more. With a prisitine 605 acre lake, a shaded brook, a small forested area, toys and activity space we have ample opportunity for individuals and groups to have wonderful experiences together.</p>

          <h2>Fall 2015</h2>

          <br>

          <p>A major Capital Campaign was launched to empower the camp to build, rebuild and renovate in preparation for present and future ministry demands. The vision is big. Our mission is powerful.</p>

          <p>If you want five star facilities, and Disney World experiences do not look to us...but, if you are attracted to what God has created, with a few man-made toys, activities and amenities thrown in for maximum enjoyment, then we just might be the place for you.</p>
