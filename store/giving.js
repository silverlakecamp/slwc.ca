So in addition to not needing to pay capital gains, you would be issued an official donation receipt for the full value of the securities you may so donate.  If this is something of interest to you, we can confirm that through Canada Helps, you may donate securities to SLWC.  Click here to access their site and follow the instructions provided there.`,
