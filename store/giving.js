      description: `<p>Wow – What began as a dream in the summer of 2012 finally arrived in 2016. The waterslide was dedicated in May 2016 and has been getting plenty of use since. It is a great attraction for kids and various age groups - a number of geezers have used it.  Our goal in purchasing this slide was to attract more people to the camp, recognizing that once they get here we continue to participate in making and shaping them into Disciples of Christ.  We thank the Lord for providing this tool to further His ministry here at Silver Lake!</p>

      <p>Over the past six years, a total of $54,925.64 was donated towards the slide.  As the final cost of the slide was $80,713, we used funds out of the operational budget to complete the work.  Donations are still being directed towards the shortfall of $25,788.  We invite you to help us make up this shortfall and ask you to consider donating the cost of 1 inch ($58.00), 1 foot ($701) or another amount as you determine.</p>
