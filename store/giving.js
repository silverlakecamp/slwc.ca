       title: 'Giving Tuesday',
       description: `Giving Tuesday started in 2012 when the 92nd Street YMCA in New York City and the United Nations Foundation joined together in search of a way to harness the spirit of giving that comes with the end of year holiday season and channel that toward support for non-profit organizations. Many non-profits take this opportunity to allow their supporters to kick off the holiday season with a gift to an organization that they care about. Giving Tuesday takes place the Tuesday after Black Friday and Cyber Monday.`

Your donation of all (tuition costs between $340-395 typically) or a portion of a camper's registration will make all the difference for some deserving camper.

So in addition to not needing to pay capital gains, you would be issued an official donation receipt for the full value of the securities you may so donate.  If this is something of interest to you, we can confirm that through Canada Helps, you may donate securities to SLWC.  Click here to access their site and follow the instructions provided there.`,
